<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
<p>
    I figured that I should pick again a workshop on nodeschool, and then the workshop I picked is javascripting.
    Overall the workshop is very easy, can be finished in about 1-2 hours. Learned a little bit. But hoping to learn more
    on the sequel workshop named functional javascript.
